# Credit Card Input form
A Component to add credit card input to your react native application. For Android & iOS.

*Forked from the original project in order to improve usability* since users often recognize the have input a wrong card number only after typing the name, to have an horizontal form extending outside the view seems to be appealing but it's useless to come back. The only way to go on the first field (card number) in the original project was to click one by one all previous fields in order to restore the scroll axis (this could have been fixed with a scrollable=true property). Furthermore it's pretty unusual to have x-axis forms on a mobile ux and users do prefer fields that are always visible. It has also been implemented a new style form following the iOS10 design.

Code:

```js
// fullpage with credit card flipcard
<CreditCardInput onChange={this._onChange} />
// single-line with horizontal scrolling
<LiteCreditCardInput onChange={this._onChange} /> 
```

# Features
* [iOS 10 form design](https://github.com/lexor90/react-native-credit-card-input/blob/master/form.png?raw=true)
* Customizable credit card that flips as you type to show credit card fields (inspired by: [card](https://jessepollak.github.io/card/), [react-native-credit-card](https://github.com/sonnylazuardi/react-native-credit-card))
* Scalable credit card
* Lite version for smaller screens
* Credit-card input validations & formatting as you type
* Integrated with [card-validator](https://github.com/braintree/card-validator) by braintree to display credit card type
* Auto-focus next field as you complete correctly one
* iOS native form design (customizable if you want to)

# TODO
* Add Android form design

# Usage

```bash
npm i --save react-native-credit-card-input-fullpage
```

then add these lines in your react-native codebase

```js
import { CreditCardInput, LiteCreditCardInput } from "react-native-credit-card-input";

<CreditCardInput onChange={this._onChange} />
// or
<LiteCreditCardInput onChange={this._onChange} />

// Note: You'll need to enable LayoutAnimation on android to see LiteCreditCardInput's animations
// UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental(true);

```

And then on your onChange handler:

```js
_onChange => form => console.log(form);

// will print:
{
  valid: true, // will be true once all fields are "valid" (time to enable the submit button)
  values: { // will be in the sanitized and formatted form
  	number: "4242 4242",
  	expiry: "06/19",
  	cvc: "300",
  	type: "visa", // will be one of [null, "visa", "master-card", "american-express", "diners-club", "discover", "jcb", "unionpay", "maestro"]
  	name: "Sam",
  	postalCode: "34567",
  },
  status: {  // will be one of ["incomplete", "invalid", and "valid"]
	number: "incomplete",
	expiry: "incomplete",
	cvc: "incomplete",
	name: "incomplete", 
	postalCode: "incomplete",
  },
};

// Notes: 
// cvc, name, & postalCode will only be available when the respective props is enabled (e.g. requiresName, requiresCVC)
```

# Methods
## setValues
Set values into credit card form


```js
	// sets 4242 on credit card number field
	// other fields will stay unchanged
	this.refs.CCInput.setValues({ number: "4242" });
```

**Known issues:** clearing a field e.g. `setValues({ expiry: "" })` will trigger the logic to `move to previous field` and trigger other kind of weird side effects. **PR plz**


## focus
focus on to specified field

```js
	// focus to expiry field
	this.refs.CCInput.focus("expiry");
```
